# Problem 10: Summation of primes

The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below n.

### Note:

We are solving this problem by using "Sieve Of Eratosthenes" to build an array of prime numbers below "n".

- recommended for N <= 10 million
- Time Complexity = O(nlog(log n))
- Space Complexity = O(n)

**Steps**

1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, â€¦, n).
2. Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
3. Starting from p2, count up in increments of p and mark each of these numbers greater than or equal to p2 itself in the list. These numbers will be p(p+1), p(p+2), p(p+3), etc..
4. Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
