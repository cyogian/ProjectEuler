# ProjectEuler

This repository contain my solutions to ProjectEuler problems. The solutions will be coded in Python 3 and Javascript.

---

### Note

There may be two different versions of the same problem:

- One on [Project Euler Official Site](https://projecteuler.net/archives) 
- Another on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/) 

In such a case the project euler version will we placed inside a separate file "euler\_" prefix.
The freeCodeCamp version would be considered as primary.

- You can test the solution by running **python test\_\*.py** in the respective folder.

It is recommended that you do not view the answers to this challenge, but instead visit Project Euler and work through the challenges yourself.
