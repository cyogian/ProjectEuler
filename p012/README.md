# Problem 12: Highly divisible triangular number

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

```
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
```

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

```
1: 1
3: 1, 3
6: 1, 2, 3, 6
10: 1, 2, 5, 10
15: 1, 3, 5, 15
21: 1, 3, 7, 21
28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28
```

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over n divisors?

### Note

Solving this problem in three steps using 3 subsequent functions.

- A function that calculate the consecutive triangle numbers while checking the no. of factors for each triangle number and stops when the no. of factors exceed given number.
- A function that calculates the number of factors for a given number using the product of degrees of all the prime factors of a given number.
- A function that calculates the degrees of each prime factor of a given number.
